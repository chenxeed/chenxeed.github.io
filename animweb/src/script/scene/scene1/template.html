  <p>Once upon a time, there was a legend...</p>
  <p>Oktip, a place of sanctuary. A land where humans can live happily with beautiful breeze and resourceful nature.</p>
  <p>Sadly, the place has been occupied by Asura. A mighty evil that wants humanity to be his servants. No mortals can resist nor fight below Asura's hands.</p>
  <p>Except one...</p>
